# We started the Avian Ecology & Migration Lab at UTRGV! 
#
We conduct research in the School of Integrative Biological and Chemical Sciences at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). We study the ecological mechanisms underlying species resilience under local and global change, with emphasis on migratory populations. Our Lab implements a combination of cutting-edge tools including tracking devices and molecular methods. We promote a novel framework in Movement Ecology by advancing data analysis through R programming language and by offering a systematic application of multi-disciplinary techniques.
